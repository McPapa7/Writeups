  The main objective of this site is to provide solutions with explanations to
  the rooms available on platforms such as TryHackMe, HackTheBox and eventually
  others.

# Introduction

I like to include a TLDR section at the end of my writeups for several reasons:

* It provides a summary to anyone that has just worked through the room using the writeup.
* Lets people assess whether the room is something in their wheel house if they are wondering if they should start it.
* Some rooms will have multiple routes to the final destination and a someone who has completed the room can find out if my writeup takes a different path they may be interested in.
